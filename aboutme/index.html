    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
    <p>I had already received my degree in English from UVU, but afterwards found I really enjoyed working with computers when I started working for Ancestry.com. So, I decided to go for a BS in Applied Technology from BYUI.</p>
    <p>My husband and I live in Utah with our three children right around the corner from their grandparents!<br>When I had my first child, I quit my job 2 years later and became a stay-at-home mom.</p>
    <p>This program is perfect for anyone wanting to a get another degree and still needing to be at home. When I re-enter the workforce, I want a different career--something I'm passionate about.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life. My favorite quote from President Nelson is "Each day is a day of decision, and our decisions determine our destiny." And one of my favorite scriptures is Alma 26:12.</p>
