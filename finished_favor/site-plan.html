      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Also included on the homepage will be blog posts of new skus to sell. The blog will also be where our social media will focus. The blog posts can be fun and interesting, perhaps going over techniques, processes, or materials I use. I can also run free giveaways, surveys, and competitions through the blog to keep the posts fresh and interesting. They can then be put on all the social media platforms easily like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and the biggest of all Pinterest. I will also include affiliate links to buy supplies at other stores, such as Amazon or Joanns, in case people would like to try to make the cards on their own. This will broaden my income to not just selling cards, and I will probably also run ads as well to increase my net profit. Because of the blog, the marketability of my site will increase tenfold. If people are seeing my blog posts over and over on their social media, it will increase name recognition and when it comes time to pick out a greeting card for their loved one, they’ll come to me instead of my competitors. I also am in a niche market where I will only do pop-up or interactive greeting cards. This will set my shop above the rest and the craftsmanship will keep my customers coming back for more.

      <h3>Shop</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the bread and butter of the website, the real, true purpose of its existence. I make the cards because I like to but also need to sell them to make money. This website will be a digital storefront for my card-making business Finished Favor. This will allow me to sell my finished products without having to go through middlemen such as Amazon or Etsy. There will be a shop area where people can search for particular cards, scroll through my listings, add things to their cart, and checkout. I will include a way to mark favorites, so that users can save them for later.  I will also have new skus available regularly, so my customers do not become bored with my offerings. I will use seasonal availability to my advantage to create a need to purchase the item now before it’s gone. I will also give coupons to the users who purchase cards as a way to get them to come back again. An annual sale might be a good idea, probably some time in the summer to clear out the old stock. The biggest card-selling holiday is actually Easter, followed by Valentine’s Day, so I don't want the sale to be any closer than that to Easter. A customization option will be added to each sku which will be a larger fee for additions like adding the recipient’s name, personal message, graphics, changing the colors, shipping directly to the recipient, etc. I will probably do free shipping on orders that are over a certain price.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        This will be a section where I can have a biography about myself and a portrait. I can explain my passion for card-making and anything else about me I would like to share. I can explain why my cards are of the highest quality and make and will give a spiel of how their recipients will absolutely adore them and appreciate the thought behind the card. I could also probably include a similar section about my card-making partner. At the bottom, I can also include a FAQ to be able to answer any kinds of questions the users might additionally have, e.g. shipping concerns, new release schedules, re-selling products, return policies.
